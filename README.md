# Predict-Fuel-Efficiency

we aim to predict the output of a continuous value, such as a price or a probability.Here I have used one of the famous datasets among machine learning practitioners, Auto MPG dataset to create a model to predict fuel efficiency of vehicles in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

To do this, we will provide the model with a description of many automobiles from this period. This description includes attributes such as cylinders, displacement, horsepower and weight.
